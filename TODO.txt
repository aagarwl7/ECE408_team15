Bugs:
- energy calculation only adds element contributions from one block

Additional Features:
- add magnetization calculation kernel !!
- both the energy calcuation and the energy difference calculation have loops over lattice 
	elements that could be further parallelized
- parallelize the loop over all temperatures (loop in main.cu)
- take average of energys in last few iterations of for loop over steps in kernel.cu
	(may not be necessary when using enough lattice elements, which requires fixing
			 energy calculation bug)
- move random number generation into kernel !! DONE
- telescope into discontinuity in temp vs energy; may need extra lattice elements, iterations
- store energy contributions of each point in lattice in memory
	- may not work since every change in lattice changes every contribution, but could be good estimate if lattice values change frequently enough
- use shared memory in energy difference calculations !!
- generate lattices on device, using rng !!

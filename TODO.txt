Bugs:
- energy calculation only adds element contributions from one block

Additional Features:
- both the energy calcuation and the energy difference calculation have loops over lattice 
	elements that could be further parallelized
- parallelize the loop over all temperatures (loop in main.cu)
- take average of energys in last few iterations of for loop over steps in kernel.cu
	(may not be necessary when using enough lattice elements, which requires fixing
			 energy calculation bug)
- move random number generation into kernel
- telescope into discontinuity in temp vs energy; may need extra lattice elements, iterations
